PLAN
====

+ Combine Game and GameController
+ Put all player stuff in Player (bombs, hubs)
+ Encapsulate Rubgame event handling in Game
+ Factor out Viewport

+ Sprites loaded from image files
+ Press a button to fire a bomb
+ Rotate angle to fire

- Try Gosu? Texplay?
- 100% spec coverage, metrics
- Sprite image colouring with player colours
- Bombs damage things they land on
- Hub health meters
- Hub destruction
- UI to select what to fire
- Fire hubs
- Building chain links
- Terrain height
