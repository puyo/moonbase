 * Sound: Ogre SoundManager
 * Input: OIS
 * Scripting: Lua
 * Networking: Zoidcom
 * Physics: ODE

=== Maps ===

 * 3D

 * map is a 3D surface (nurb / mesh / whatever) loaded from a heightmap
 * vertices have heights
 * interpolate height between verticies
 * need measurement of flatness => fitness for building
 * map borders like Medieval II
 * textures on surface, based on terrain types + skin (decals?)

 * projectiles
 * x,y,z (z = height above ground, x/y = cart coords)

=== Networking ===

 * Zoidcom
 * processing done on server
 * clients animate pretty send moves to server
 * could still cheat via bots but meh
